# Selenium-Web-Scraper
In this code, I have used Selenium as a base to automate scraping information from webpages. Scraping information is vital to gather relevant insights and sources for analysis and thus, I have tried to create a code to automate scraping information from specific attributes such as the webpage's XPath and also the images.
