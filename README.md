# Selenium-Web-Scraper
In this code, I have used Selenium as a base to automate scraping information from webpages. Scraping information is vital to gather relevant insights and sources for analysis and thus, I have tried to create a code to automate scraping information from specific attributes such as the webpage's XPath and also the images. It worked to some degree when I was doing my side project of creating a dashboard of Street Fighter V Characters, iterating to its wikia website. However I have come to realize that each webpage might have a different structure which makes it a bit complicated to create a standardized code that can work to all kind of webpages. Nonetheless, this was a good experience for me.
